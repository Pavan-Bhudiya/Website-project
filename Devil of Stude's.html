<h1>DEVIL OF STUDE'S</h1>
<p>Hii guys sorry for not updating but cant entirely take the blame, we had exams so was quite busy. Umm.... well actually I  wanna write about exam pressure today more specifically cause I have just finished my exam recently. One of the problem that young people face is exam and its shadow- exam pressure. The question we should ask ourselves  is what is an exam , exam pressure and what is the purpose of an exam? Exam is a test that is set for the youth to test their knowledge and how attentive they are to the respective subject teachers. Exam pressure is a feeling of pressure that many young pple feel  exam time nears. It usually occurs during revision period before exams. It can be caused by parents over-expecting from their children(which a'int wrong too), peer pressure and expecting too much from urself I am not saying its bad to expect, set targets that are achievable, otherwise ull end up disappointing urselves.</p>
<p>According  to my own research 80% of students face this problem. Don't think the smart pple don't experience it. They do experience it but not as much because they have prepared well. They just need a quick walk-over like 5min before exam unlike most of us who have to cram a whole topic 1min to exam, which leads to panic mode being set on.</p>
<p>So lets discuss the reasons why the youth experience such. The first reason is feeling confused on where to start and where to end. Most pple face this problem thus showing that they haven't been revising, they are only revising when they have known its nearing exam time. This habit is wrong as for u to succeed u need that constant practice and perserverance.</p>
<p>Another problem is feeling moody and lazy, most youth don't revise because they don't have that "sike" as its called in sheng. But tbh therez no shortcut to cope with this u just gotta push urself to sit down and read and grab the concept in the book if u wanna pass.</p>
<p>To all those nearing an exam all the best, to those prepping for one remember us till got enough time to turn the tables and achieve ur dream scores, so get ur asses down and start revising. NO MORE PROCRASTINATIONS GUYS!! U GOT ALL WHAT IT TAKES TO PASS SO PROOVE ALL UR HATERS WRONG COME ON!</p>
