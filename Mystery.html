<h1>MYSTERY</h1>
<p>Wassup my people...I'm back with freshly brewed content. So here's dedicating this post to covid-19, don't get me wrong here I'm not gonna go all scientist mode to explain what this virus is about and precautions to take etc. Im probably writing to express the other perspective of this pandemic probably we haven't seen.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact we were all most probably quarantined by force(get this right- government measures before u all trollers start trolling me) of by self-will to avoid spread of coronavirus. Taking a keen look at this, did u know mother nature is taking a break while we had been locked up in our houses-less cars so less pollution, less work stress, students got some relief from their studies(which isn't a bad thing after all is it?)...and pls keep the other factors or ur views aside for a sec. Mahn this is like the world has come to a sudden halt... I mean flights being cancelled, pple not shaking hands, wearing masks.... did u ever think what would ever happen if this suddenly became the reality of our everyday life had our doctors not being our saviours? Think about it once again!!!!</p>
<p>Im not saying that covid 19 happened due to us, there might be other factors that come into play of course, what about the other pandemics we as humans cause? littering everywhere, destroying the environment, noise pollution, disrespect of one another- maybe thats why to teach us a lesson we have had a rough 2020 yr?  Coronavirus is showing us how powerless we are- we are basically 'slaves' of nature who have come to play a positive role(to improve the nature rather than destroy it) but some of us are doing the total opposite.</p>
<p>Why arent we able to give up our egos and say sorry and admit or mistakes- we gotta understand that life's too short. Take a simple example of  string the more knots we tie in it the shorter it becomes; in a similar manner, the more grudges we hold( fill in the remaining statement respectively).</p>
<p>In conclusion, if uv been affected directly or indirectly by covid 19, im praying for u everythings gonna be ok dont lose hope...u can play ur part by following the precautions we r continuously being given by our heroes-our docs- and don't forget to pray for the world...God bless lets meet in the next one....until then goodbye!!! And btw don't forget the drill do follow and let me know ur thoughts in the comments section, or u can get in touch with me via Instagram- supercoolking.cheerios!</p>
