<h1>NO WORRIES</h1>
<p>Hey guys, so I am back. Hope u didn't miss me(sorry for that cheesy line but I guess it"s the side effects of not writing something for almost a year). Well its holiday time so I managed to squeeze out some time from my busy schedule of homework(yes!!, during holidays).</p>

<p>The thing that actually pushed me to write this is one of my close ones. She of late has been having terrible mood swings of late, emotions running left, right center. You know that teenage phase when an  ocean of emotions suddenly hits you and starts making you wonder what the hell you are doing with your life, esp after high school,  it's really overwhelming to be frank. So she is actually going through that phase. Almost every time I would go and meet up with her, she would always be lost in her inner self looking into the horizon. Surprisingly, every time i asked what was wrong only one reply would be forwarded,"I'm fine relax.</p>

<p>So I decided to do  something. I would visit her often and take her out for strolls and try to open up some of my deepest secrets so as to hopefully unleash her building pressure. To my utter disbelief she one day just spilled the beans. She explained everything to me. She said the way she felt helpless and unable to do anything...anything excited..fun something that would act as a step towards her reaching her life's dreams( a pharmacist to be specific).</p>
<p>All I replied was"Take a deep breath,you will be fine...where you are meant to be, you will be in time.</p>
<p>At times in life, we will be surrounded by mountains of problems which we think affect us only. But in real sense, these problems are just a mirage in our head, some natural because of our hormonal changes or teenage phase that  we undergo and others just because we over think on the problems that  surround our lives eg. financial crisis etc. which may in actual sense may be quite small issues.</p>
<p>We just need to continue looking on the positive side of everything which always seems so difficult in such situations, but as the saying goes" The day you plant the seed is not the day you eat the fruit." We just need to keep on adding water of patience and fertilizer of positivity as we wait for our hard work to bear fruits.</p>
<p>And guess what she(my friend) actually managed to put one foot  forward towards her dreams which she used to tell me of everyday. These news became music to my ears when she told me she got admission in her dream university.</p>
