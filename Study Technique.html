<h1>STUDY TECHNIQUE</h1>
<p>In this blog ill straight get to the point.The title is self explanatory as it  may seem. I am writing this post mostly for my fellow colleagues who may be trying so hard to get good grades and probably are on the verge of giving up trying to achieve their goals. Well i have noticed that there are many study techniques if one searches on the internet whether utube google and one wonders which is the best,proved, which method works best for me etc?A long list of qns is what it boils down to so one doesnt know which path to tread on and in the end what happens the circle goes on and one lands where they started.</p>
<p>Ill try my luck of help in it. After tons of research and advice on people following the method im about to explain i think this method works best for pple who follow it diligently. </p>
<p>The method is called active recall method("the name doesnt make a difference here" i know thats whats ur prolly thinking)It simply involves active recalling info, by active i mean so that it sticks for a long time without having to go back to the particular info every now and then. One mistake i have to point out among students which i used to do before also is that we leave reading to the last one week before exams when we get a exam timetable. Thats the first trap we fall into- we r meant to be reading a little everyday. By reading i mean readin actively; by now ur like whats reading actively- lemme break it down a little here:when writing notes we are retaining info pasively thats why before a teacher tells us to write notes before the particular topic(eg brain parts) when the lec starts teaching ull only have very little info like u remember u wrote about brain or a particular striking standing out word (eg cerebellum) only bcz u liked how the word soundedðŸ˜‚Point is u dont retain enough info to face an exam or to generally understand the topic.</p>
<p>So in simple terms all u are to do is lets say uv come from schul had a nap done ur other duties easted a ton of time in phone/tv until u sit down at ur study table(hopefully) to do ur homework. You have to sit down also not only to finish ur hw but also take a look at ur notes and what u have been taught that day.Once u have finished looking at ur notes that kicks in the dopamine and gets it going-mind u me u have to read that topic un qn as if ur prepping for an exam tomorrow but what makes the difference is u have to read it calmly and when ur at peace not when ur stressed and biting ur nails a night before. Another thing while reading form qns eg (name parts of brain and state fns of each). After ur done reading the whole topic try answering the qns again.After about 2 days try answering the qns and see how well u can answer them.Repeat the procedure for other subjects covered within the day. The more u answer these qns ull see the info sticking in ur head for longer time therefore u wont have much content to cover as the exam approaches. At times when ur bored of the schedule you can answer past paper qns for a diifferent experience an sharpen ur answering qn ability. Exposing urself to various formats of qns enables you not only grasp the content effectively but also help you point out which concepts are most tested in a unit and how to answer bcz at times the teacher is not only checking ur qn answering ability but also whether u know how to correlate concepts from different topics. </p>
<p>In summarty that brings me to the end of my blog. I  hope my target has reached bull's eye. If you manage to follow this procedure and start seeing results and liked this procedure pls do reach out to me lemme know in the comments about ur experience.Adios!</p>
