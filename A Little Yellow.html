<h1>A LITTLE YELLOW</h1>
<h2>THE BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO A BETTER PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP.</h2>
<p>Well, lets begin this by me thanking whoever is back to this site to read a new piece. Furthermore i do apologise for not posting a new post. A lot has been going on lately to put this short and frankly. Lets get to the post today shall we,hang on and hope u stick to the end. I hope that i do managed to keep you sticking with me on the next page.</p>
<p>Let the title not misleed you here. I only mean to explain one side of the story obviously based on how i see it from my angle of view. Here i am only trying to send a message to my peeeps ie. my peers. I think as this generation we tend to take for granted quite a few things. Basing on the title i bet u must have already guessed- yes ur relation with ur mom/dad. Look it up u may as a child may take quite many things for granted. Get this from me, however independent you may make urself appear 99% u are dependent on ur parents- irony or shocker u decide!!</p>
<p>Think of a typical day lets take a simple scenario- ur on holiday obviously u wake up late after late night binging on netflix where u cared no shit about ur sleep schedule ever since u finished schul exams. U wake up bfast is ready at the table-hold up there ...did ur bfast walk to the table i bet not it was cooked by someone {by whichever means in one way or another} ur parent played a role in making it appear ready at the table. To add cherry on top of the cake prolly its someting thats ur favourite meal- who did this ur mom/dad. Next on ur up and about with friends or u still continue exhausting ur preplanned netflix list of films. Lunch time the story repeats itself same to dinner.</p>
<p>Another scenario money u need for whichever purpose i bet it doesnt grow on trees. Your parents work their ass off to earn the amount they r earning everyday to make ends meet and give u all the comfort u need starting from small things u may ignore as the light bill ur netflix account ur wifi....was that an eye opener? i hope so!!</p>
<p>Lemme ask a simple qn...how would u feel if u did so much for someone like u really put in effort hardwork and put ur best foot forward and boom this person backstabs u or doesnt appreciate ur efforts...lets make this more simpler and relatable shall we... lets get to it...my boys out there assume u do all that u can u love ur gf and then u found out shez chated on u or for girls out there ur bf did the same....does that hurt...i bet it would and not little it hurts a lot. Now lets get back on track shall we...lemme help i guess if that same person said thank u and appreciated ur efforts it would be a joy that cant be expressed into meaningful words right? i know!!now lets get things straight here...cant you do the same and say a simple thank u to ur parents for the hard work they r doing for u....not so difficult i assume.</p>
<p>Maybe some parents sacrificed a lot for them to make u reach the comforts u so enjoy everyday as if its a simple task.Im not overpraising parents here all im trynna say is i bet our live as their kids is way easier than them so why not have a good family talk at the dinner table where everyone expresses how their day went and where u can thank ur parents for their effort. Works wonders i tell u i have tried and tested it.</p>
<p>Next view, do u spend maybe not everyday but at least one day with ur family esp ur parents on individual basis. I would prefer that if its possible create time for them make sure before the next day u have managed to talk to them about ur day or anything in general...fun fact... ur parents in the stage of life they are at they dont crave for u to earn and become successful that falls 2nd...1st crave is that their kids spend time with them more than they spend with friends. By the way i dont mean that ur friends company is bad. but i mean that u shoud be closer to ur parents more than u do with outsiders.And i bet ur like where do i get time i come home from schul they come late from work or im caught up with studies etc etc....but get the bold truth from me.... those are nothing but MEER EXCUSES!!!! A wise man once said if u truly care for the person u wont need to say" im busy ill look when im free to meet u" for that person  ull create time even from that busy schedule however tight the schedule might be. Hehe just for u to know that wise man is me.ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‰ I mean surely dont u also prioritise things to meet ur friends or meet ur gf/bf so how difficult can it be to do the same for ur parents. Probably uv never given that a thought but u better do so.</p>
<p>Do this simple task for me...its pretty simple..assign ur one day to urself as in where ull not take help from ur househelp or either of ur parent.. all that happens within the day like cleaning the house, dishes, clothes(even if its in the washing machine), cooking ur food, ur bed everuthing begginning to end ull do it urself.  I bet even before i finished making the list of duties ur like how will i do that ur heart skipped a beat ur like how will i do that all by myself...now just take a breath there..if only the thought scared u imagine actually doing it. The other side is ur like thats easy ill do it not hard but get it from me ive tried that experiment guess what happened i ate 1 burnt toast only the whole day and almost burnt my house down that dayðŸ¤£ðŸ‘€. That shows how much dependent i am on my parents. I remember my sis told me one thing which i keep close to my heart till date that if u wanna know u share a good relationship such thats its an unbreakable chain ask urself do u share as much with ur parents as u do with ur so called friends remember the word "friend"has END while "family" has ILY (i love u). Poetic i know ...my sis at times suddenly awakenes the poet she has hidden within herselfðŸ˜‚like the smouldering effect that dwayne johnson has in jumanji. Those words really hit deep mahn!!!Damn. Those words were magic. Indeed from that day my mom is now my bestie trust me i would share everything however small it can be like even if i was to have a gf my parents would know first. Maybe my friends dont know that much about me than my mum and get to know that if the reverse applies to u THEREZ A PROBLEM A GRAVE PROBLEM INDEED!!</p>
<p>At this point u might be like yh ill try all this that the blogger has said above...but reading wont make a difference u have to proove ive managed to create a change in you by replicating the stated. dont say ill start from tomorrow start now from this moment u never know what tomorrow has in store for u..so its a kind request pls  and by me requesting doesnt mean u exactly follow my words word to word..if u have another way to express my point apply it to u as long as we both achieve the same results its all cool there r many ways to kill  a rat after all.But do lemme know which ways u chose in the comments below do reach out to me i mean it would help me feel good to also receive positive feedback from my readers, for those who feel to contend my content also lemme know it helps me improve my writing.</p>
<p>So lemme now end this end tiring topic(tiring bcz it can never be fully exhausted) here. Hopefully ill try update more sooner and do feel free to gimme ideas on what to write on next.I do have a prototype in my mind for now its not concrete enough but to give u a teaser. Do u have issues like ur having to cram all ur exam content everytime before ur exam then stay tuned the next blog may be just the one u need.</p>
<p>Until then thank you for sticking till the end and hope u liked it. See u in the next one.</p>
