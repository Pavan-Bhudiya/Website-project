<h1>Connections</h1>
<p>Simple qn to kickstart todays blog...whats a connection?Well a relative term to descibe a lot of things with this 1 word ya.. sometimes easy to say but complex to describe.</p>
<p>We tend to really undermine this word. In this hustle and bustle of the city u know...breathe and take a pause moment and feel the fresh wind give u a fresh breath of new life.Everythin around u is connected like the delicate strings of a spider web i mean look at the serenity - somehow involves depending on each other and its a whole cycle i mean wow how beautiful of an artwork is that...sun rising and setting everyday and that too punctually...u waking up to commence ur duties of the day(well u may not be all the time - a little cheat day is allowed ya?) etc. </p>
<p>Paradoxically, if i were to tell u that u are actually connected but not connected believe me i speak the very truth in that.Maybe this losing of connect with not only ourself but our imediate enviro is not entirely our fault but maybe a side effect of urbanization i would say. No particular person to blame but our daily duties really disconnect us from who we really are wev become so busy that we r just passing this limited time that our creator has bestowed us with rather than actually living it-merely existing;it has reached a point where we just dont have time to check up on the pple we once loved during some part of our life!!How crazy is that like some1 who meant so much to u now only existing as a memory/name/pic/voice and faded away exponentially from ur mind. And when the person goes back to meet his creator u regret why u didnt spend enough time with them and write eulogies about how good the person was when in reality u may have not met the person in ages(im not against writing eulogies btw-its a reality check that may be applying to some of us-no hard feelings PS)</p>
<p>Sometimes take time to walk in the hospital to just ask how those terminally ill patients yearn that if they just had one more chance and more time to live this beautiful experience called life once again. Look at the hopelessness a doctor faces when he cannot help his patient or loses one in the OT so live actually live this life other pple r yearning for. As i pass the corridors thru the hospital everyday its a whole flood of emotions and endless chain of thoughts of what goes on behind those old rusted damp walls the tsunami of emotions i mean its a feeling thats just unfathomable. I mean in such a small geographical area a billion emotions echoing and clashing against each other-one room a mom and her family celebrates the comin of a new life while the other prepares to receive a truth that will change their lives forever and mourn their hearts out as they grieve the loss of one of their kind...connections it is u say.For some pple  walls whose paint has worn out ,have  moss growing on walls and dust layers accumulating on window sills of classrooms  may be a sign that there has been no human haituation there but for me i have a different angle of view-it shows how oblivious we hav become ..i suddenly start imaging movie scenes u know horror types where the scene is similarðŸ˜œ(maybe im becomin creative and i might be inspired to become a writer after all) ...by sayin this i dont mean u always paint walls or suddenly change the architecture of ur house but start thinking like our english teachers...didnt get that line? Lemme explain...</p>
<p>U remember back in high schul when reading setbooks and a particular scene eg "john is eating spaghetti...."used to appear for us it was a direct meaning statement but out teacher would interprete that as"eating of spaghetti by john illustrates how poor john was and the difficulties he has faced..."ðŸ¤£ Back on track i mean start being more empathetic towards the pple around u start living in the moment and truly being present.</p>
<p>I had much much more to say but im tired of typing maybe ill bring a part 2...wait why dont u guys lemme know in the comment if u want a part 2 or if u need any other topics written onðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜ŠCherios</p>
