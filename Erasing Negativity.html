<h1>ERASING NEGATIVITY</h1>
<p>Hey guys, so ur guy is back in action again writing. First and foremost, I wanna thank all those guys that keep on requesting me to constantly be updating my blog, some say that it really encourages them and motivates them too. And for those guys who never fail a chance to demotivate and discourage me GET A LIFE PPLE!!!</p>

<p>So of late I've noticed that many guys have the wrong attitude esp when approaching a hurdle in their life. Since I'm still a student I've narrowed down to a very small example. In our school by end of 3rd term of f1 we have to choose which subjects we wanna retain and continue to learn and those which we wanna drop. Well I know my fellow students must be thinking by now that what's hard in that, just choose the subject u perform in well, the one u enjoy learning etc. . The most queer reasons I heard was just choose the 1 with the teacher u like and choose the one ur bestie is taking. Like seriously, how can those reasons or should I say EXCUSE be used to judge which subject ull take, is that even normal?</p>
<p>Looking keenly into the matter, it may seem an easy job to choose subjects on the above mentioned basis, but have u ever sat down and thought by urself that now this small mere decision can play a key role in deciding the career u will pick later on. A small wrong step can change the direction of ur career. I'm guessing by now my fellow stude's must be like what's  this ''over-serious'' and over-ambtioned dude telling us ati choosing subjects wrongly can mess up my life and career? Bullshit!!(P.S. no offensiveness meant). Imagine if u aspired to be a lawyer and u took a wrong decision now and took geo instead of history or u wanted to become an entrepreneur and took comps instead of business, ull regret it later on in life wont u?</p>

<p>So all what I'm tryna say is think critically and if needed take ur parents advice if need be so. And not only in choosing subjects, if u notice most of us students we end up losing some of the challenges we face in studies even before we start. I know u must be taken aback like how is it possible to lose before u start, and my answer is yes IT IS POSSIBLE. Of course if u already give up before attempting and start telling urself ''I cant do this task, I'm not capable....choose the ''chopi'' of the class to make the presentation'' etc.  trust me 200% ull not be able to do it, but for once try telling urself ''I can do it, I will do it and not give up until I succeed'' trust those words u will be able to complete the assigned task. THE WORDS I CAN ARE HIDDEN IN THE WORDS I CANT ITSELF. Let the word impossible for u mean I'm possible.</p>

<p>So from now henceforth I hope I have managed to open the ''blind'' eyes and made light at the end of the tunnel for those reading this post. I might be late or not God willing in adding another post but let that not dishearten u I will try my best to continue updating. Once again thank u for the guys following my site and pls do share this with ur friends and family an many others too and oh yh before I forget, don't forget to leave comments {ur feedback is highly appreciated} on how the post was, and do leave any ideas on what topic u guys would like me to write about next time. Until next post bye and God bless u all.</p>
